# Search_Engine_Indexer

This is the indexer created for the Search Engine "Sherlock Search". This search engine was a final project of CIS455/555 at the University of Pennsylvania. Without the other pieces of the engine, it is unable to complete the full job of a search engine, but asin indexer it can stand alone with the proper inputs and outputs.

Within the "Sherlock Search" group, we were each tasked with different jobs. Within that team, the Indexer was my responsibility, with front-end design and testing being my secondary, but still important, functions.
